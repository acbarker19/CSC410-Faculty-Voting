# Faculty Voting
A website that allows faculty members to vote on new committee members during an election. This was the final project for my Web Database Programming course (CSC410) at the University of Mount Union taught by Dr. John Kirchmeyer.

This website was intented to allow faculty members at the University of Mount Union to run as nominees in various committees during an election. Eligible users would be able vote on the nominees during the election period and view the results afterwards. Admin accounts would be able create users, elections, committees, etc.

Due to time constraints and technical difficulties surrounding Github, the project was not completed.

## Completed Features
- Sign in page that connects to the database to check if the user input matches an existing account
- If a user tries to access a page that they are not permitted to view, they are given an error message
- Admin accounts can create/edit elections, committees, and faculty members.
- All users can view the list of current committees and their members
- All users can view the results of the latest election

## Incomplete Features
- Voting in an election
- Assigning nominees to their potential committees for an election
- Assigning winners to their committees after an election
- The election results notify the user of a tie between nominees
